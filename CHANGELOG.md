# Changelog

All notable changes to this plugin are documented here. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [2.1.0]

- **BLE Manager**
 - This is now tested as stable, and using it means much less chance of interference between BLE plugins on the same server, so it is now the default option if enabled on the server
  - BLE Manager can be switched off from plugin config if you want to go back to direct `bluez` access
- **Elite 100V2**
  - Additional mappings to monitor AC output voltage when inverter on, and AC input current from shore power
- **Decimal Values**
  - All values now shown using same precision as offered by Bluetti, so volts/amps/watts/temperature will show with decimal places rather than as integers if the device supports that


## [2.0.3]

- Attempts to auto-release now a previous stuck GATT claim when using the new BLE Manager on SignalK

## [2.0.2]

- Fix for device not recognized when using the new BLE Manager option

## [2.0.1]

- When using BLE Manager, repeat scans if no device found initially

## [2.0.0]

- Optional support for SignalK server's new BLE Manager API
  - Requires SignalK Server version >= 2.31.0)
  - Config has a **Use the SignalK BLE Manager API** setting, only shown when the server supports it, off by default.
  - Lets this plugin share the BLE adapter with other BLE plugins through the server instead of opening its own BlueZ session.

## [1.5.1]

- Simplify the custom device configuration override
- 'Register Map' is now 'Device Configuration'
- Bundled register maps moved from `registers/` to `devices/`

## [1.5.0]

- Expanded Bluetti model support, over 20 now with register mappings
- Configuration moved from CSV to YAML
- Configurable directory to add YAML files for unsupported Bluetti models
- CLI `models` command lists supported register maps with field/constant counts

## [1.4.1]

- Basic test suite

## [1.4.0]

- Normalize and extend paths for SignalK
  - Elite 100 v2 now publishes 12 paths, the AC200P 22
- Metadata update for package, including git repo transfer
- README and CHANGELOG now included in package
- CLI commands now guess MAC address if one not provided
- CSV files now can provide static defaults, e.g. for DC output voltage, where the unit itself does not expose this over BLE

## [1.3.2]

- Correct SignalK paths so state of charge shows as a percentage
  - From `electrical.batteries.<id>.stateOfCharge` to `electrical.batteries.<id>.capacity.stateOfCharge`

## [1.3.1]

- Back off if bluetooth daemon not available at startup
- Fix scaling of current state of charge value

## [1.3.0]

- Fix handling of node-ble 128-bit UUIDs
- Fix encrypted reads for Elite v2 BLE
  - Confirmed successful values read from an Elite 100 V2
- CLI now has separate `dump` and `info` commands for raw and interpreted data

## [1.2.0]

- Stop scanner going into continuous scan loop if configured device not found
- Add discovery timeout
- Added CLI to scan and inspect devices
- Build tools added oxfmt and oxlint to improve cod quality
- Fix upstream EventEmitter leak in `@naugehyde/node-ble`

## [1.1.2-alpha]

- Fix crash on scan completion

## [1.1.1-alpha]

- Add timeout handling for BLE connect/polling

## [1.1.0-alpha]

- Switch BLE backend from `@stoprocent/noble` to `@naugehyde/node-ble` (BlueZ D-Bus), so connections persist across disconnects without needing a rescan

## [1.0.8-alpha]

- Improve connect/reconnect behaviour

## [1.0.7-alpha]

- Validate the encryption key file; stop scanning once a device connection starts

## [1.0.6-alpha] and earlier

- Initial register map support, BLE scanning, and encryption-key auto-detection, plus assorted fixes leading up to the first alpha releases

## [1.0.0]

- Initial release
